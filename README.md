# text-adventure-game

A text adventure game built using JavaScript and OOP principles

The core premise of the game is to win the game by gaining access to the West Wing (which is initially locked to you) by collecting medallions. You can collect medallions in your inventory by defeating each room (Wing) in the game, at which point going back to the lobby will prompt a special message for you.

All images and dialogue were created by myself.
